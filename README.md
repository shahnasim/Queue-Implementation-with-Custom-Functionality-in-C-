# Queue Implementation with Custom Functionality

## Overview
This program implements a circular queue in C++ using the `arrayQueueType` class. It provides standard queue operations along with the ability to move the `n`th element to the front of the queue.

## Features
- Add elements to the queue (rear)
- Remove elements from the queue (front)
- Retrieve front and rear elements
- Check if the queue is full or empty
- Move the `n`th element in the queue to the front
- Print all elements in the queue

## How to Use
1. Compile and run the program.
2. Input the number of elements for the queue.
3. The program will populate the queue with integers from `1` to `n`.
4. View the current queue.
5. Enter the position of the element you'd like to move to the front.
6. The updated queue is displayed.

## Example
Please enter the number of elements: 5 Print the elements: 1 2 3 4 5 Enter the position to move the element: 3 Updated queue: 3 1 2 4 5
